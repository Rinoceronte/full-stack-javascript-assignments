# Variables

> What are variables used for? Why are they important?

## Requirements

1. Create the following variables:
    ```js
    export var message = 'hello';

    export let greeting = 'Yo!';

    export const saying = 'What up';
    ```
2. Can you assign a new value to message? (Assign 'world') yes
3. Can you assign a new value to greeting? (Assign 'Hello!') yes
4. Can you assign a new value to const? (Assign 'Booyah') no


## Observations

1. What is the difference between var and let? let is only available within it's block scope var can be available in other blocks.
2. What is the difference between let and const? const is a constant, can't be changed after instantiated.
3. When should you use let versus const? when you need to change the var at times.
