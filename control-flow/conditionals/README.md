# Conditionals

> Why do we need conditionals? What do we do day to day to use conditionals in our language? What are some examples of a conditional statement?

### Requirements

1. Create a function named ```greeting(age)``` that takes ```age``` as an input parameter.  Return a string that says ```'Hello!'``` if the age is above 18.  Return ```'Yo!'``` when the the age is less than 18.
2. Create a function named ```isTacoTuesday(day)```that takes ```day``` as an input parameter.  Return true if the day is equal to 'tuesday' and false if it's not.


### Observations

* What types of conditionals are there?
    * How is each type useful?
        *if and else if statements ternary statements.
